The Anbernic RG35XX is based on an Actions Semi ATM7039 SoC with a PowerVR SGX-544 GPU. It has a resolution of 640x480, 256MB of RAM, and uses a SDCARD for its firmware.

The custom firmware (CFW) described in these pages installs entirely into a SDCARD without requiring any modification of the stock RG35XX console. The main effort of this firmware is to provide compatibility with the latest [batocera linux](https://batocera.org) release.
